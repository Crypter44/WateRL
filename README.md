You can currently find two Modelica water networks in this repository. They were created with Dymola 2024x and compiled as FMUs for Windows and Linux. If you face problems while using the FMUs, test the corresponding unit via [this website] (https://fmu-check.herokuapp.com/).

Furthermore the code in the folder `code` shows how to interact with the FMU using [sofirpy](https://sofirpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). It may be helpful to have a look at [fmpy](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy)
